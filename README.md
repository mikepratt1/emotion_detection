# emotion_detection
Using PyTorch to develop an emotion detection app.

Currently WIP, emotion_notebook.ipynb is an experimental notebook where I have played around with transfer learning as well as implementing a custom convolutional neural net with an attention mechanism added through a spatial transformer network. Transfer learning was proving infeasible due to computational resources which lead me to implementing a model from the paper "Deep-Emotion: Facial Expression Recognition Using Attentional Convolutional Network".
